# Configuration

This document covers Radar's cluster connection behavior. For CLI flags and basic usage, see the [README](../README.md#usage).

## Persistent Configuration

Radar stores configuration in two files under `~/.radar/`:

### Config File (`~/.radar/config.json`)

Persistent defaults for CLI flags. CLI flags always override these values. Managed via the Settings dialog in the UI or `PUT /api/config`.

```json
{
  "kubeconfig": "",
  "kubeconfigDirs": [],
  "namespace": "",
  "namespaces": [],
  "port": 9280,
  "noBrowser": false,
  "browser": "",
  "timelineStorage": "memory",
  "timelineDbPath": "~/.radar/timeline.db",
  "timelineMaxSize": "0",
  "historyLimit": 10000,
  "prometheusUrl": "",
  "prometheusHeaders": {},
  "mcp": true,
  "debugImage": ""
}
```

All fields are optional — omitted fields use built-in defaults.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `kubeconfig` | Path to kubeconfig file (same as `--kubeconfig`) |
| `kubeconfigDirs` | Directories containing kubeconfig files (same as `--kubeconfig-dir`) |
| `namespace` | Initial namespace filter |
| `namespaces` | Initial namespace filters as a list (same as `--namespaces ns1,ns2,ns3`) |
| `port` | Server port (default 9280) |
| `noBrowser` | Don't auto-open browser |
| `browser` | Browser for automatic launch (same as `--browser`; on macOS, app names like `Google Chrome` are supported) |
| `timelineStorage` | `memory` or `sqlite` |
| `timelineDbPath` | Path to SQLite database |
| `timelineMaxSize` | Max SQLite DB + WAL size before pruning oldest events (`0` disables) |
| `historyLimit` | Max timeline events to retain |
| `prometheusUrl` | Manual Prometheus/VictoriaMetrics URL — skips auto-discovery. Useful when Prometheus is not in the same cluster or uses a non-standard service name. |
| `prometheusHeaders` | HTTP headers sent with every Prometheus request. Required for auth-protected backends — e.g. `{"X-Scope-OrgID": "my-org"}`. Equivalent CLI: `--prometheus-header Key=Value` (repeatable). Stored in plain text in `config.json` — protect the file accordingly. |
| `argoCdUrl` | Manual argocd-server URL for the Argo CD API integration — skips auto-discovery. |
| `argoCdToken` | Argo CD API token (get-only account recommended). Stored in plain text — the file is written `0600`; the token is redacted from `GET /api/config`. |
| `argoCdInsecureTls` | Skip TLS verification for argocd-server (self-signed default installs). Scoped to the Argo CD client only. |
| `prometheusHeadersFromEnv` | Header values read from environment variables at startup — e.g. `{"Authorization": "PROMETHEUS_TOKEN"}`. Equivalent CLI: `--prometheus-header-from-env Key=ENV_VAR` (repeatable). Use this with Kubernetes Secret-backed env vars in Helm deployments. |
| `mcp` | Enable/disable MCP server for AI tools (default: enabled) |
| `debugImage` | Image for ephemeral debug containers and node debug pods (same as `--debug-image`). Empty = `busybox:latest`; point at a mirror for air-gapped / private-registry clusters. |

### Settings File (`~/.radar/settings.json`)

User preferences for the UI. Managed via the Settings dialog or `PUT /api/settings`.

```json
{
  "theme": "system",
  "pinnedKinds": [
    { "name": "Deployments", "kind": "Deployment", "group": "" }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Values | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `theme` | `light`, `dark`, `system` | UI theme preference |
| `pinnedKinds` | Array of `{name, kind, group}` | Resource kinds pinned to the sidebar |

## Cluster Connection Precedence

Radar connects to Kubernetes clusters using the same configuration sources as `kubectl`:

| Priority | Source | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `--kubeconfig` flag | Explicit path to kubeconfig file |
| 2 | `KUBECONFIG` env var / `--kubeconfig-dir` flag | Either can provide kubeconfig(s); mutually exclusive alternatives |
| 3 | In-cluster config | Automatic when running inside a Kubernetes pod (`KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST` is set) |
| 4 | `~/.kube/config` | Default kubeconfig location |

## KUBECONFIG vs In-Cluster Detection

When Radar runs inside a Kubernetes pod, Kubernetes automatically sets the `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST` environment variable. This normally triggers in-cluster configuration using the pod's service account credentials.

However, **explicit kubeconfig takes precedence**. If you set `KUBECONFIG` or pass `--kubeconfig`, Radar uses that instead of in-cluster config. This allows you to:

- Run Radar inside a pod but connect to a different cluster
- Use specific credentials instead of the pod's service account
- Test with a custom kubeconfig while developing inside a cluster

**Example: Override in-cluster config**
```bash
# Inside a pod, connect to a different cluster
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/other-cluster.yaml
kubectl radar
```

This behavior matches `kubectl` and follows the [Kubernetes client-go precedence rules](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/43662).

## Multiple Kubeconfig Files

`KUBECONFIG` can contain multiple file paths (colon-separated on Linux/macOS, semicolon-separated on Windows). Radar merges these files following Kubernetes conventions:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config:~/.kube/staging-config:~/.kube/prod-config
kubectl radar
```

Alternatively, use `--kubeconfig-dir` to load all kubeconfig files from a directory:

```bash
kubectl radar --kubeconfig-dir ~/.kube/configs/
```

## Context Switching

Radar supports switching between Kubernetes contexts at runtime through the UI. Click the context selector in the header to switch between available contexts.

When running in-cluster (using the pod's service account), context switching is disabled.

## Namespace Picker

The header has a namespace picker on the right. Pick a single namespace to focus the view, or **All namespaces** to see everything you have access to. Cluster-scoped resources (Nodes, Namespaces, PVs, StorageClasses) appear regardless of the pick if your RBAC permits them — they have no namespace to filter on. Namespace-restricted users without their own cluster-scoped RBAC won't see cluster-scoped sections at all.

The pick is a per-user view filter — it doesn't change anything for other users sharing the same Radar instance. Locally, your pick is remembered per kubeconfig context across restarts. In shared (auth-enabled) deployments the pick lives for the session.

Until you make a pick, local sessions default to the namespace set on the kubeconfig context (kubectl parity — the same namespace `kubectl` would use, including one set via `kubectl config set-context` or `kubens`). An explicit `--namespace` / `--namespaces` flag outranks the kubeconfig value, and contexts without either default to **All namespaces**. Once you pick namespaces or explicitly choose **All namespaces**, that choice sticks for the context and the kubeconfig value is no longer consulted.

If your account can list resources inside several namespaces but cannot list namespaces cluster-wide, start Radar with an explicit list:

```bash
kubectl radar --namespaces ns1,ns2,ns3
```

Radar probes each listed namespace for access and watches every namespace where access is granted — resource views then cover all of them, not just the first. The list is also each user's initial picker selection: locally via the launch URL, and in shared (auth-enabled) deployments as a per-session default seeded on first read. Clearing the picker back to **All namespaces** sticks for the rest of the session. The picker can switch between those namespaces or keep several selected at once.

This covers built-in resource types and custom resources alike: CRDs (GitOps, Gateway API, etc.) are probed per-kind across the same list and watched in every granted namespace. The list is capped by `--max-scope-candidates` (default 20) — startup fails with a clear error rather than silently probing a subset.

When Radar starts with `--namespace-scope`, the picker controls the process-wide cache scope instead of just a view filter. Namespaced informer caches are pinned to one namespace while cluster-scoped resources remain cluster-wide. Local/no-auth sessions can switch the scoped namespace, which rebuilds the cache in place. Auth-enabled and Radar Cloud sessions lock the picker to the startup namespace so one user cannot reshape the shared backend cache for everyone.

**Single namespace only.** `--namespace-scope` pins the cache to exactly one namespace; scoping to several namespaces at once is not supported yet. Passing more than one (e.g. `--namespace=a,b`) fails at startup with a clear error rather than silently caching nothing. When scoped, the namespace picker becomes single-select, and a switch re-points the whole cache to the new namespace rather than adding to it.
